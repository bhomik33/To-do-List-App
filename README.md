# To-do-List-App
Welcome to To do List app! I built this iOS app to learn Apple's Swift UI, a brand new framework for building user interfaces for iOS, tvOS, macOS, and watchOS. 
SwiftUI was first presented by Apple in 2019 and has been rapidly evolving since then. SwiftUI is a cross-platform framework, unlike UIKit and AppKit.
I made this app by following an amazing tutorial on You Tube by Swiftful Thinking (https://youtu.be/EPdivac0kwE)
